# Route Finder

This is a web application built with Streamlit that helps users find routes between two locations using the OpenRouteService API. It allows users to select travel modes (Car, Walk, Bike) and provides a dynamic map with directions, along with the ability to download the route as an HTML file.

## Features
- **Geocoding:** Converts city names or addresses into geographic coordinates using OpenRouteService.
- **Route Calculation:** Computes the route between the origin and destination for various travel modes.
- **Interactive Map:** Displays the route dynamically using Folium maps.
- **Downloadable Routes:** Allows users to download the route directions as an HTML file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-name>/route_finder.git

   ```
3. Add your OpenRouteService API key:

     ```
4. Run the app:

   streamlit run app.py
   ```
